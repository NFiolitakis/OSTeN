OSTeN - Open Source WebRTC Telemedicine
=====

OSTeN is the new WebRTC Telemedicine app from Open Source Health http://www.opensourcehealth.com

OSTeN focuses on having a co-created medical note, edited by both the Provider and the Patient. For our note co-editing we are using Etherpad as the core. Our Telemedicine component is a fork of the Etherpad ep_webrtc app.

Using Etherpad and WebRTC together we are trying to entirely re-imagine the telemedicine experience.

Speifically:

* We support both the patient and the clinician editing the medical note in real time.
* We support multiple clinicians, patients and patient caregivers or patient advocates meeting using the same telemedicine app
*
